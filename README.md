<h1>CAMPFIRE CAMPUS README.MD</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Campus Campfire is site site for college students who whan to connect, create events and leave their review on these events. As well students can select if they want to attend to an event and rate it onece it takes place.

## Landing page for first time users

The landing page allows users to see a display with all the upcommimg events ordered in chronologically way, being the closest one, the first appearing on the top of the page.

Besides, right at the top the users can see the logo of the page in bright blue with a navbar under it that contains the main sections of the site: Home, Register and Login. Alonside with the navbar, on the opposte side of the page the user can find the footer with the names of the developers who worked together on this project.

## Home page (Site Logo)

The first element that the user sees when visiting site, is the logo: Campfire Campus in big, bright blue font. 

- User experience in the Logo section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the site.

  - The name of the site "Campfire Campus" indicates clearly that this is a website related with the academic world. In addition, the name indicates that it is a place for socialising and students are welcomed. 
  
  - Thanks to the Logo the user would feel comfortable and with a positive attitude even before checking the rest of the page.

## Home page (Events) 

The Home page focuses mainly on the display of the events, as we mentioned before the events appeared ordered in time. Each event is enclosed in a black square to differentiate it from the rest of events. The main features that can be highlighted are:

- The name of the event is as well a clickable button for the user. 

- Under the event name, the user can see the location, the date, and the creator of the event each one with a descriptive icon.  

- On the top right corner, the user can see the number of available spots and the number of participants attending with icon next to it. 

- Finally, on the bottom right corner there is a clickable button for those students who want to register.

- User experience in the events section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the event and the button for registering.
 
  - The icons give important visual information about the event (location, date, author, number of participants) and help the user to navigate through the information provided.

  -The colour animation on the attending icon gives 
  
   - The clickable button is easy  to identify, as it stands alone on the right corner, besides it gives straight and intuitive access to the new user who wants to register for an upcoming event.

## Home page (Navbar and footer) 

Apart from the events section, the Home page also povides the user with a useful navbar and a informative footer. The navbar is divided into three main areas of interest; Home, Register and Login and the footer proportionates information of interest about the developers that collaborated on this project. The main features that can be highlighted are:

- The clickable sections in both, the navbar and the footer 

- The colour animation when the user hoovers over the clickable parts.

- The change in the cursor icon when the user hoovers over the clickable parts.

- User experience in the navbar and footer section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the different sections that can be found on the navbar.

  - The colour transition animation in the navbar and the footer, as well as the change in the cursor icon, both give clear indications about the clickable property of the elements in these sections. Besides, they produce an eye-catching effect on the user when these elements are hoovered over, creating the need for clicking and a sense of mystery.

  - The Git hub cat icon in the footer,  gives important visual information about the names, as it makes explicit their contribution as developers in the project.

## Design Choices

We selected a rich and colourful style, using bright high contrast colours. We want the user to feel immersed in the experience of visiting our website. We derived our colours from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
“Bright Accent Colors”
#242582
#553D67
#F64C72
#99738E
#2F2FA2

We selected the font style Poppins 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'. It works well as a fun, slightly futuristic, slightly unusual font; but not unusual enough to overpower the rest of the page.

## Wire Frames

## Quiz page

We ensured that we provided wireframes to cover all the different stages of user experience and features
