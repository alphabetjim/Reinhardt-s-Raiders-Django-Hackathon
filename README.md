allows users to provide their name so that they are greeted by name on return visits. 

There are drop menus to adjust difficulty, category, how many questions, and question type. There is also a social media button to easily share Quiz-E. 

It displays the Quizzee Rascals brand logo clearly for brand recognition. It also provides the option to share Quiz-E with friends and family on social media.

## Design Choices

We selected a rich and colourful style, using bright high contrast colours. We want the user to feel immersed in the experience of visiting our website. We derived our colours from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/
“Bright Accent Colors”
#242582
#553D67
#F64C72
#99738E
#2F2FA2

We selected the font style Poppins 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap'. It works well as a fun, slightly futuristic, slightly unusual font; but not unusual enough to overpower the rest of the page.

## Wire Frames


<strong>Landing page for First Time User followed by Options Pages for repeat users<br></strong>

  <tr>
    <th>Bug/Issue</th>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </tr>
  <td>"Select type" option overflows to below options box on smaller devices</td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/bugs/fixed/questionsoverflow.png" alt="Image showing box obscuring the logo on larger devices"></td>
    
  <td>We added media queries to ensure effective responsiveness</td>
  </tr>
      
  </tr>
    <td>Quiz-E would display without questions and just show questions marks when user left all questions to default(i.e.Any).</td>
   <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/bugs/fixed/questionsdontshow.png" alt="Quiz page showing selected option and timer displaying 2 seconds elapsed"></td>
   <td>We required the user to enter Questions Length, and API call modified to accommodate this by leaving the “any” option off the API call.</td>
  </tr>
      
  </tr>
    <td>Sometimes after answering several questions the questions would stop changing</td>
   <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/bugs/delay.png" alt="Quiz page showing selected option and timer displaying 2 seconds elapsed"></td>
    
  <td>The problem lay was that when too many requests were made from the API in too small a space of time. Therefore to fix this we implemented a required delay of three seconds between committing answers</td>
  </tr>

## Unfixed Bugs / Issues

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bug/Issue</th>
    <th>Image</th>
    <th>Resolution</th>
  </tr>
  <td>On large devices the "Enter name" box obscures the brand logo and feels like a pop-up rather than an integrated element of the UX package</td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/amiresponsive/loginscreenpng.png" alt="Image showing box obscuring the logo on larger devices"></td>
    
  <td>Unfortunately we ran out of time to fix this. We would in future sprints change from an in-browser alert box to a html modal box, that would be styled and centred on the screen etc as part of a user management system.</td>
  </tr>
      
  </tr>
    <td>Sometimes quiz repeats questions, or includes them from higher difficulties. As an example of both, this question came up twice in a quiz set to easy.</td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/bugs/repeatdifficultforbugpage.png" alt="Image showing difficult question"></td>
    
  <td>Unfortunately none available as source of questions is the API. The only fix would have been to change the API from a paid provider but this would be costly and we would have had to change too much code by the time we realised</td>
  </tr>
    
  </tr>
  <td>Three second delay between answer and next question</td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/readMeImages/bugs/delay.png" alt="Quiz page showing selected option and timer displaying 2 seconds elapsed"></td>
    <td>The delay was a fix to a bug of the site crashing when too many requests were made from the API in too small a space of time(see "Fixed Bugs" above). The only fix would have been to change the API from a paid provider but this would be costly and we would have had to change too much code by the time we realised</td>
